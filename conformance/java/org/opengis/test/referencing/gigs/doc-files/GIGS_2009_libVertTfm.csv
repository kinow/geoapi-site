# Test 209, Application pre-defined geodetic parameter library - Vertical Transformations, v1_2009-12-01.
#
# Instructions:
# Compare the definitions of vertical transformations in the application pre-defined library with those in the EPSG Dataset. Those listed below are #the minimum that should be reviewed.
# (The information below has been taken from EPSG Dataset v6.18 of November 2008. The most recent version of the Dataset should be used).
# (This list identifies items of especial interest to the E&P industry for geodetic integrity testing purposes; it is not a fully inclusive list of #items of interest).
#
# Columns:
#  [ 0]: EPSG Coordinate Operation Code
#  [ 1]: Particularly important to E&P industry?
#  [ 2]: Transformation Name(s)
#  [ 3]: Coordinate Operation Method
#  [ 4]: Remarks
